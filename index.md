### About Me

I was born in Blantyre, Malawi in 2006. At five years old me and my family moved to New York City. After living there for a bit under a year, my family moved yet again, to Port Chester. After two years, we then left for Edison, NJ. After another year, we moved to East Brunswick, where we still live today. My personal interests include technology, economics, chess, and literature.
